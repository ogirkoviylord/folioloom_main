# DeepSeek Document Telegram Bot Design

## Goal

Build an independent Telegram service for paid document translation through DeepSeek API. The service accepts common text documents first, then expands into ebook, subtitle, office, scanned, and legacy formats. It estimates price before work starts, runs translation in background workers, and returns a translated file to the user.

## Clean-Room Boundary

This project is written from scratch. The implementation must not copy AGPL code, file layout, function or class names, prompts, tests, configuration, or internal architecture from AGPL projects. The project may use general product ideas, public API documentation, open file format documentation, and independently selected permissive libraries.

## MVP Architecture

The MVP is split into small services that can run locally with Docker Compose:

- Telegram bot process for user interaction.
- FastAPI application for healthchecks and internal service endpoints.
- PostgreSQL database for users, orders, payments, settings, and task state.
- Redis-backed queue for background work.
- Worker process for document analysis, translation, and result assembly.
- File storage abstraction with local storage in development and S3-compatible storage later.
- DeepSeek client as the only LLM integration.

The user never chooses an LLM provider. DeepSeek model and pricing settings are controlled by service configuration and admin tools.

## Current Prototype Scope

The current local prototype is a runnable Telegram bot with in-memory state. It is not yet the full paid production service, but it already exercises the core document translation loop end to end.

Implemented prototype capabilities:

- Bot interface language selection is the first user step after `/start`.
- Interface messages are localized for Russian, Ukrainian, French, Spanish, and English.
- The user can upload TXT, DOCX, or EPUB files.
- The bot validates file extension and size before creating a pending translation.
- The bot detects and displays the probable original document language when source language is configured as `auto`, for example `auto (English)` or `auto (unknown)`.
- After upload, the user chooses the target translation language separately from the interface language.
- The bot shows file name, direction, fragment count, and price estimate before confirmation.
- The user can press a localized Back button before confirmation to discard the pending translation and return to the main menu.
- The user can confirm with a localized button or `/confirm`.
- During translation, the bot shows a progress bar with translated fragment count and percentage.
- During translation, the bot shows a localized Cancel button and also documents `/cancel`.
- Cancellation stops after the current fragment, marks the job as cancelled, and returns a partial translated file with `.partial` in the name.
- Translation errors are logged internally with traceback but shown to the user as generic localized failure messages.
- End-user messages must not mention the internal LLM provider.

Prototype storage and processing limits:

- User settings, pending uploads, jobs, and cancellation state are stored in memory.
- Translation currently runs inside the bot process through a synchronous runner wrapped from the async Telegram handler.
- The prototype does not yet include real payments, user balances, PostgreSQL persistence, Redis queue workers, object storage, admin tooling, or production retries.
- TXT translation groups paragraphs up to the configured fragment size.
- DOCX translation currently handles main document paragraphs and preserves the DOCX package at a basic level.
- EPUB translation currently translates XHTML text blocks such as headings, paragraphs, list items, and table cells while preserving the EPUB archive contents around them.

## MVP Data Flow

1. User selects the bot interface language.
2. User sends a document to the Telegram bot.
3. The bot validates format and size.
4. The service stores a pending upload and extracts text for estimation.
5. The service detects the probable original document language when source language is `auto`.
6. The bot shows the detected original language and asks for the target translation language.
7. The bot shows price, fragment count, direction, and confirmation controls.
8. User either goes back to the main menu or confirms the translation.
9. In the production service, user confirmation charges balance and queues the order. In the current prototype, confirmation starts translation immediately in process.
10. Worker or prototype runner splits the document into ordered fragments.
11. Worker or prototype runner translates fragments through the internal LLM integration.
12. The bot shows progress while fragments are translated.
13. User may cancel while translation is running. Cancellation stops after the current fragment and assembles a partial result.
14. Worker or prototype runner assembles a translated file.
15. Bot sends the final or partial result and stores it in history until file TTL expires in the production service.

## Supported Formats

The service must treat file formats as separate adapters. Every adapter has its own extractor, estimator, assembler, and risk label for the user. Unsupported or low-confidence documents must fail before payment.

### MVP Formats

- TXT: plain text input and plain text output.
- DOCX: extract and replace paragraph text while preserving the original DOCX package as much as possible.
- EPUB: translate XHTML content files and preserve ebook metadata, manifest, spine, images, styles, and navigation.
- PDF: support text-layer PDFs first; scanned PDFs require OCR and must be clearly marked as a slower, higher-risk mode.
- RTF: convert rich text to an intermediate representation, translate text runs, and return RTF or DOCX depending on conversion quality.
- FB2: translate XML text nodes while preserving book metadata and structure.
- SRT and VTT: translate subtitle cues while preserving timing, cue numbering, and WebVTT metadata.

### Extended Formats

- ODT: translate OpenDocument text content while preserving package structure and styles where possible.
- HTML and HTM: translate visible text nodes while preserving markup, links, attributes, scripts, and styles.
- MD: translate Markdown prose while preserving headings, lists, links, code blocks, tables, and front matter.
- CSV and TSV: translate selected text columns only; preserve delimiter, quoting, encoding, and row count.
- DjVu: OCR-first format; use only when the document has no reliable embedded text.
- MOBI and AZW3: convert through ebook tooling into EPUB-like content, translate, and return EPUB or converted output when quality allows.

## Third-Party Components for Format Support

The project is written from scratch, but may depend on independent third-party tools and libraries with compatible licenses. Each dependency must be pinned, documented, and isolated behind an adapter so it can be replaced later.

### Text and Encoding

- `charset-normalizer` or equivalent: detect input encoding for TXT, CSV, TSV, SRT, VTT, RTF, and legacy text files.
- Unicode normalization utilities from Python standard library: normalize extracted text before chunking and translation.
- Optional language detection library: detect source language for warnings and analytics, but user-facing translation must not depend on provider selection.

### DOCX

- Python ZIP and XML tooling, or a permissive DOCX library such as `python-docx`: read and write OOXML packages.
- `lxml` or Python XML libraries: preserve XML namespaces and modify text nodes safely.
- No Microsoft Office dependency is required for MVP DOCX support.

### EPUB, HTML, and FB2

- `ebooklib` or equivalent: read EPUB container, manifest, spine, and metadata.
- `beautifulsoup4` plus `lxml` or an equivalent HTML/XML parser: identify visible text nodes and avoid translating scripts/styles.
- XML parser with namespace support for FB2.
- Optional EPUB validation tooling (`epubcheck`) for QA in development or background validation.

### PDF

- `PyMuPDF` (`fitz`) or `pypdf`: extract text-layer PDF content and page structure.
- `poppler` tools or MuPDF command line utilities: render pages to images for OCR fallback and diagnostics.
- For MVP, translated PDF input may produce DOCX or TXT output if faithful PDF reconstruction is not reliable.
- Full PDF reconstruction is an extended feature because layout preservation is expensive and error-prone.

### OCR for Scans, PDF Images, and DjVu

- OCR engine: Tesseract OCR as the default open-source baseline, or PaddleOCR/EasyOCR as optional higher-quality alternatives.
- Language packs: Russian, Ukrainian, English, French, and Spanish OCR data must be installed for the interface and target markets.
- Image preprocessing: OpenCV or Pillow for deskewing, binarization, contrast adjustment, rotation detection, cropping, and page splitting.
- PDF page rendering: Poppler or MuPDF for producing high-resolution page images before OCR.
- DjVu support: DjVuLibre tools (`ddjvu`, `djvutxt`) to extract embedded text or render pages for OCR.
- OCR confidence tracking: low-confidence pages must be flagged before payment or routed to a safer output mode.
- OCR output format: scanned documents should return DOCX or TXT in MVP; preserving the exact original scan layout is an extended feature.

### RTF, ODT, and Office Conversions

- LibreOffice headless mode: convert RTF, ODT, and some legacy office files into DOCX or HTML for extraction and output assembly.
- Pandoc: optional conversion path for RTF, Markdown, HTML, and some ebook/text formats.
- `striprtf` or `unrtf`: lightweight RTF text extraction fallback when full layout preservation is not needed.
- Conversion workers must run in a sandboxed environment with timeouts and file size limits.

### MOBI and AZW3

- Calibre command line tools (`ebook-convert`, `ebook-meta`): convert MOBI/AZW3 to EPUB or HTML-like intermediate content.
- DRM-protected ebooks are not supported; the bot must reject them with a clear user-facing message.
- Output should default to EPUB unless reliable round-trip conversion to the original format is validated.

### Subtitles

- Subtitle parser library or a small independent parser for SRT/VTT timing blocks.
- Timing lines, cue identifiers, styling tags, and speaker markers must be preserved.
- The translator must receive only cue text, not raw timestamp blocks.

### CSV and TSV

- Python `csv` module or equivalent structured parser.
- User must be able to choose which columns to translate in an extended UI; MVP may translate all non-empty text cells with strict row/column preservation.
- Encoding and delimiter detection are required before price estimation.

### Safety, Security, and Operations

- Antivirus scanning such as ClamAV is recommended before processing user-uploaded files.
- Archive and document parsers must run with strict size, page count, timeout, and memory limits.
- External converters must run without network access and with isolated temporary directories.
- Every conversion step must produce structured logs with input format, output format, duration, warnings, and failure reason.
- The system must store original files, intermediate files, and translated results with separate TTL policies.

## User-Facing Format Policy

- The bot must not mention the internal LLM provider.
- The bot may show format-specific warnings, for example: scanned PDF/DjVu translation takes longer; OCR can make recognition mistakes; exact original layout is not guaranteed.
- The bot must ask for confirmation after showing the target language, estimated price, expected time, and output format.
- The bot must clearly distinguish interface language from target translation language.
- The bot must show the detected original document language when source language is automatic.
- The bot must show the same fragment count before confirmation and during translation progress.
- The bot must provide a Back action before confirmation so the user can discard a mistaken upload.
- The bot must provide a visible Cancel action during translation, in addition to the `/cancel` command.
- If translation is cancelled, the bot must return already translated content as a partial file whenever at least one fragment was translated.
- If a document requires OCR or conversion, that must be included in the estimate before payment.
- If the service cannot preserve the original format reliably, it must offer a safe output format such as DOCX or TXT before charging.

## Progress, Cancellation, and Partial Results

Long-running translations must keep the user informed and in control.

- Progress is displayed as translated fragments over total fragments and as a percentage.
- Progress updates must not block Telegram polling.
- Cancellation is cooperative: the service does not abort a currently running LLM request, but stops before the next fragment.
- Cancellation state is tracked per active user translation.
- Cancelled jobs use a dedicated cancelled status, not failed.
- Partial output file names include `.partial`, for example `book.uk.partial.epub`.
- TXT partial output contains translated fragments only.
- DOCX and EPUB partial output replace translated blocks and leave untranslated blocks in the original language.
- Internal error details are logged for developers, but end users receive generic localized failure messages.

## Fragment Counting Policy

Fragment counts shown to users must match actual work units.

- TXT estimates use the same paragraph grouping policy as TXT translation.
- DOCX estimates must count the same paragraph units that DOCX translation sends to the translator.
- EPUB estimates must count the same XHTML text blocks that EPUB translation sends to the translator.
- Future optimization may group multiple small EPUB blocks into one API request, but the estimate and progress counters must change together.

## Translation Modes

The MVP supports user-facing modes, not provider selection:

- Fast: lower-cost default instructions.
- Quality: stricter translation instructions and additional validation where useful.
- Terms: uses user-provided terminology instructions.

All prompts must be written specifically for this project.

## First Development Slice

The first implementation slice created a runnable backend skeleton with:

- project packaging and test runner;
- typed application settings loaded from environment;
- FastAPI healthcheck endpoint;
- Telegram greeting text builder;
- Docker Compose placeholders for app, bot, worker, PostgreSQL, and Redis.

This slice does not call Telegram, DeepSeek, PostgreSQL, or Redis yet. It establishes the project shape and test discipline before adding external integrations.

## Completed Prototype Milestones

- Project skeleton, test runner, README, Dockerfile, and Docker Compose placeholders.
- Settings and healthcheck API.
- Clean-room Telegram bot text builders.
- DeepSeek-compatible chat completion client and smoke probes.
- TXT validation, estimation, translation, and result file generation.
- DOCX extraction, estimation, translation, and basic DOCX result assembly.
- EPUB extraction, estimation, translation, and EPUB result assembly.
- Localized bot interface for Russian, Ukrainian, French, Spanish, and English.
- Separate interface language and target translation language flows.
- Localized confirmation buttons.
- Back button for discarding unconfirmed pending translations.
- Visible Cancel button and `/cancel` command for active translations.
- Cooperative cancellation with partial TXT, DOCX, and EPUB results.
- Progress display during translation.
- Source language display for automatic language detection.
- Internal logging for hidden translation failures.
- Test coverage for core pricing, extraction, language detection, job runner, translation runner, bot messages, and bot translation service.
